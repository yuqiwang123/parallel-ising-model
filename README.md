# Parallel Ising Model Simulation

## Ising Model
Ising model is a well-known model in statistical physics. The 2D Ising model consists of N$\times$N spins which can be in two states: up(+1) and down(-1).

Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate Ising model with Metropolis algorithm.

## Parallization
The N$\times$N model can be divided into blocks which are updated .
