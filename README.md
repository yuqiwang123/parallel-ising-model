# Parallel Ising Model Simulation

## Ising Model
Ising model is a well-known model in statistical physics. It consists of spins which could be in two states: up(+1) and down(-1). 
Monte Carlo simulation is a way to simulate Ising model.

## Parallization
The N \times N model can be divided into blocks which are updated .
